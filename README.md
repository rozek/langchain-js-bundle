# langchain-js-bundle #

a consolidated bundle of LangChainJS and LangGraphJS modules for AI examples

## Overview ##

LangChainJS and LangGraphJS are not _that_ easy to handle - particularly, if you want to load everything dynamically into a browser-based IDE and avoid a bundler. In order to simplify imports for my own examples and that of my students, I've created this module which bundles important classes found in LangChainJS and LangGraphJS (and also adds a simple in-memory Vector Store)
